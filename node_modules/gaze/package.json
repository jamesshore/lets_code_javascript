Gaze will still emit or return the error as the first argument of the ready callback for you to handle.\n\nIt is recommended to advise your users to increase their file descriptor limits to utilize the faster native OS watching. Especially on OSX where the default descriptor limit is 256.\n\nIn some cases, native OS events will not work. Such as with networked file systems or vagrant. It is recommended to set the option `mode: 'poll'` to always stat poll for those situations.\n\n### Minimatch / Glob\n\nSee [isaacs's minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for more\ninformation on glob patterns.\n\n## Documentation\n\n### gaze([patterns, options, callback])\n\n* `patterns` {String|Array} File patterns to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* `callback` {Function}\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `watcher` {Object} Instance of the Gaze watcher\n\n### Class: gaze.Gaze\n\nCreate a Gaze object by instancing the `gaze.Gaze` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Gaze = require('gaze').Gaze;\nvar gaze = new Gaze(pattern, options, callback);\n```\n\n#### Properties\n\n* `options` The options object passed in.\n  * `interval` {integer} Interval to pass to fs.watchFile\n  * `debounceDelay` {integer} Delay for events called in succession for the same\n    file/event\n  * `mode` {string} Force the watch mode. Either `'auto'` (default), `'watch'` (force native events), or `'poll'` (force stat polling).\n  * `cwd` {string} The current working directory to base file patterns from. Default is `process.cwd()`.\n\n#### Events\n\n* `ready(watcher)` When files have been globbed and watching has begun.\n* `all(event, filepath)` When an `added`, `changed` or `deleted` event occurs.\n* `added(filepath)` When a file has been added to a watch directory.\n* `changed(filepath)` When a file has been changed.\n* `deleted(filepath)` When a file has been deleted.\n* `renamed(newPath, oldPath)` When a file has been renamed.\n* `end()` When the watcher is closed and watches have been removed.\n* `error(err)` When an error occurs.\n* `nomatch` When no files have been matched.\n\n#### Methods\n\n* `emit(event, [...])` Wrapper for the EventEmitter.emit.\n  `added`|`changed`|`deleted` events will also trigger the `all` event.\n* `close()` Unwatch all files and reset the watch instance.\n* `add(patterns, callback)` Adds file(s) patterns to be watched.\n* `remove(filepath)` removes a file or directory from being watched. Does not\n  recurse directories.\n* `watched([callback])` Returns the currently watched files.\n  * `callback` {function} Calls with `function(err, files)`.\n* `relative([dir, unixify, callback])` Returns the currently watched files with relative paths.\n  * `dir` {string} Only return relative files for this directory.\n  * `unixify` {boolean} Return paths with `/` instead of `\\\\` if on Windows.\n  * `callback` {function} Calls with `function(err, files)`.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Why Another `fs.watch` Wrapper?\nI liked parts of other `fs.watch` wrappers but none had all the features I\nneeded when this library was originally written. This lib once combined the features I needed from other fine watch libs\nbut now has taken on a life of it's own (**gaze doesn't wrap `fs.watch` or `fs.watchFile` anymore**).\n\nOther great watch libraries to try are:\n\n* [paulmillr's chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)\n* [mikeal's watch](https://github.com/mikeal/watch)\n* [github's pathwatcher](https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher)\n* [bevry's watchr](https://github.com/bevry/watchr)\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.\nAdd unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code\nusing [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n* 0.6.3 - Add support for node v0.11\n* 0.6.2 - Fix argument error with watched(). Fix for erroneous added events on folders. Ignore msvs build error 4244.\n* 0.6.1 - Fix for absolute paths.\n* 0.6.0 - Uses native OS events (fork of pathwatcher) but can fall back to stat polling. Everything is async to avoid blocking, including `relative()` and `watched()`. Better error handling. Update to globule@0.2.0. No longer watches `cwd` by default. Added `mode` option. Better `EMFILE` message. Avoids `ENOENT` errors with symlinks. All constructor arguments are optional.\n* 0.5.1 - Use setImmediate (process.nextTick for node v0.8) to defer ready/nomatch events (@amasad).\n* 0.5.0 - Process is now kept alive while watching files. Emits a nomatch event when no files are matching.\n* 0.4.3 - Track file additions in newly created folders (@brett-shwom).\n* 0.4.2 - Fix .remove() method to remove a single file in a directory (@kaelzhang). Fixing Cannot call method 'call' of undefined (@krasimir). Track new file additions within folders (@brett-shwom).\n* 0.4.1 - Fix watchDir not respecting close in race condition (@chrisirhc).\n* 0.4.0 - Drop support for node v0.6. Use globule for file matching. Avoid node v0.10 path.resolve/join errors. Register new files when added to non-existent folder. Multiple instances can now poll the same files (@jpommerening).\n* 0.3.4 - Code clean up. Fix path must be strings errors (@groner). Fix incorrect added events (@groner).\n* 0.3.3 - Fix for multiple patterns with negate.\n* 0.3.2 - Emit `end` before removeAllListeners.\n* 0.3.1 - Fix added events within subfolder patterns.\n* 0.3.0 - Handle safewrite events, `forceWatchMethod` option removed, bug fixes and watch optimizations (@rgaskill).\n* 0.2.2 - Fix issue where subsequent add calls dont get watched (@samcday). removeAllListeners on close.\n* 0.2.1 - Fix issue with invalid `added` events in current working dir.\n* 0.2.0 - Support and mark folders with `path.sep`. Add `forceWatchMethod` option. Support `renamed` events.\n* 0.1.6 - Recognize the `cwd` option properly\n* 0.1.5 - Catch too many open file errors\n* 0.1.4 - Really fix the race condition with 2 watches\n* 0.1.3 - Fix race condition with 2 watches\n* 0.1.2 - Read triggering changed event fix\n* 0.1.1 - Minor fixes\n* 0.1.0 - Initial release\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2014 Kyle Robinson Young  \nLicensed under the MIT license.\n",
