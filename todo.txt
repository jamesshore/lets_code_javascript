User Stories to finish current MMF:
* see other users' mouse pointers
- multi-user clear button
- multi-user line drawing
- other users' mouse pointers disappear when they leave the drawing area
- version synchronization across client/server
- offline handling
- collision-handling / conflicts / race conditions
- load management
- server monitoring / error handling
- security (handling bad data, denial of service attacks)

Engineering Tasks:
* Need to translate pageOffset to relativeOffset (do we need to improve design of offset translations?)
- Client: Receive pointer status from server
- Client: Make client display "ghost" pointers for other users
- Open question: how to make sure our test double matches our real code?
	- Use sinon.js? testdouble.js?
- Revisit Martin Grandrath's client connection design question (in E399)
- Address duplication of 'mouse' event name between client and server
- Figure out bundling and distribution for socket.io client
- Figure out how to de-dupe require paths for common files (such as "_assert.js")
	- See Scott Corgan comment, E381: http://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/comments/live/381#comment-2489897377
- Update smoke tests

To Do on current task:
* Make a HtmlCoordinate object
	- Add toString() method
	- Implement page offset translation code
	- Implement fromPageCoordinate() factory method
- Improve client.js
- Improve _client_test.js
- Remove pageOffset() and relativeOffset() from HtmlElement and its tests
- Improve svg_canvas.js to use location?
