WeeWikiPaint

Minimum Marketable Features:
* single-user painting on home page
- collaborative painting
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories:
* Create empty drawing area
- Draw one line

Engineering Tasks:
* Set up client-side testing
- Test drawing tool (Raphael?)
- Integrate into HTML page

To Do on current task:
- Set up client-side linting options
- Automatically check that we're testing against all supported browsers.
- Move testacular.conf.js to a better location
- Unify our test file location configuration (it's currently split between Jakefile & testacular.conf.js)

Future ideas:
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Abstract test framework? (Swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g., Firefox keeps open connection).
  Make it forcibly close?
- Remove Node version duplication between package.json and Jakefile.js
- Fix httpGet duplication
- Automated npm rebuild (Remove node_modules .bin directory from repository (and add to .gitignore) and 'npm rebuild' in jake.sh / jake.bat if .bin directory not found. Also add to CI script?)

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
