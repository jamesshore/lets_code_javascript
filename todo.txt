- multiple servers
- responsive design
- accessibility
- polish
  - clear button retains focus when drawing (IE8, 9, Chrome)
  - drawing glitches occur when exiting drawing area that is flush against side of browser
  - one-pixel gap on right side of drawing area (Firefox, others unknown)
  - favicon
	- 'clear' button flashes rather than depressing (iOS)
	- 'clear' button depresses diagonally rather than vertically (IE 9, IE 11)
- multiple painting/erasing tools
- save the pages (persistence / databases)
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories to finish current MMF:
* re-sync when user refreshes browser or connects to work in progress
- make mouse pointer disappear when user disconnects
- time out inactive users (make their pointers disappear)
- reconnect and resync when client is disconnected
- show disconnection warning / other UX when client is disconnected
- handle server reset smoothly (clear the drawing? re-sync to browsers? not persistence/DB)
- handle packet loss (What packet loss is possible? TCP handles this? What about unstable cellular connections?)

- version synchronization across client/server
- collision-handling / conflicts / race conditions
- load management
- server monitoring / error handling
- security (handling bad data, denial of service attacks)
	- nsp, snyk
- performance optimization
	- garbage collection pauses
	- network tick rate is currently unbounded
	- event repo stores everything, no culling
- bug: shows ghost pointer on other clients when tapping 'clear' button on mobile browsers
	- see onTouchClick_spike branch (but note document.elementFromPoint may not be testable on IE 11)
	- retire support for IE 11 first?
- bug: ghost pointers block other actions
	- e.g., starting a drag on top of a ghost pointer drags the pointer instead of drawing a line
	- e.g., clicking clear button if ghost pointer is in the way prevents button from clicking
	- investigate 'pointer-events: none' CSS
- polish: make 'clear' button depress when clear event received?

Engineering Tasks:
* Modify server to store relevant resync events
- Replay events on reconnect
- 'Extract Class' refactoring in server.js?
- Have client clear screen on reconnect (to prevent double-drawing events)

- Re-enable smoke tests' browser version check

To Do on current task:
* Clean up our event replay server test
	- Use socket.io's emit callback to determine when server receives events?
	- Test that server doesn't send replay events to other clients as a separate test?
- Discuss E502 comments

- create test-only event?
